Hi, my name is Rafael Mathias, I live in Brazil, to be more specific in Londrina/PR and I work as a Software Development Engineer in the mediation / telecom business.

I can read and write english in a proficient level and my speech is in a intermediary level, I also speak , read an write spanish in a advance level.

In programming languages I currently work with C/C++, python and Shell. I also have knowledge in Java, JavaScript and SQL, but have never work with them in a professional level.

As right now I'm studying to get my certifications in Cloud Computing (AWS / Azure) and in .NET and after that i want to expand my knowledge and experience in DevOps.

Here in my profile you can check some mock projects that I've developed as a exercise and study.
